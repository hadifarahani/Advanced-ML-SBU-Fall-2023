The algorithm iterates/repeats until V[s] is not (significantly) improving anymore. The Optimal policy (π*) is then to take every time the action to go state with the highest value. This value iteration algorithm is an example of what is referred to as [dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming) (DP) in literature. There are other DP techniques to solve this like policy iteration, etc but it can also be solved by a recursive program (a function that calls itself, look at the Bellman equation, it is a recursive definition).  \n",

    "The Q-matrix is initialized with zero's. So initially it starts moving randomly until it hits a state/action with rewards or state/actions with a penalty. For understanding, let's simplify the problem that it needs to go to a certain drop-off position to get a reward. So random moves get no rewards but by luck (brute force enough tries) the state/action is found where a reward is given. So next game the immediate actions preceding this state/action will direct toward it by use of the Q-Matrix. The next iteration the actions before that, etc, etc. In other words, it solves \"the puzzle\" backwards from end-result (drop-off passenger) towards steps to be taken to get there in a iterative fashion.  \n",

    "Note that in case of the Taxi game there is a reward of -1 for each action. So if in a state the algorithm explored eg south which let to no value the Q-matrix is updated to -1 so next iteration (because values were initialized on 0) it will try an action that is not yet tried and still on 0. So also by design it encourages systematic exploration of states and actions \n",
    "\n",
    "If you put the learning rate on 1 the game also is solved. Reason is that there is only one reward (dropoff passenger), so the algorithm will find it whatever learning rate.

So it gives the left command because if will keep you on the tile or move you up or down, but not to thr right.  \n",
